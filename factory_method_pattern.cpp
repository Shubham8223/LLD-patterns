/* The Factory Method Pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 
   This pattern is used when you need to create objects of different types but want to let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
   It's commonly used when a class canâ€™t anticipate the class of objects it must create.

   Real-World Example:
   Consider an e-commerce system where different types of shipping methods need to be instantiated based on user input or preferences.
   The Factory Method Pattern helps decouple the creation of shipping methods from the logic that uses them, allowing new types of shipping methods to be added without changing the existing code.
